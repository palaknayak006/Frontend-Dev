      <h2>The Art of Typography</h2>

      <p>
        <mark>Typography</mark> plays a vital role in web design. It not only conveys information 
        but also sets the tone and personality of a webpage. Choosing the right 
        <strong>font family</strong> and adjusting properties like 
        <em>letter spacing</em> and <em>line height</em> can transform the readability of content.
      </p>

      <p>
        In modern design, minimalism often dominates — clear, open spaces with 
        thoughtfully selected typefaces. The first impression of a paragraph can 
        be influenced by its <strong>first letter</strong> and the rhythm of its 
        <em>first line</em>, which can subtly invite readers to continue.
      </p>

      <p>
        <mark>Good typography</mark> is invisible — readers focus on the message, not the medium. 
        When you combine balanced <em>font sizes</em>, consistent spacing, and 
        harmonious alignment, you create an experience that feels professional 
        and effortless.
